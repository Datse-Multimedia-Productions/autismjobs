 * Verify Email Address for a user

 * This verifies that the user's email address is valid.
 * 
 * The verification code is sent by email, and would be very difficult
 * to reproduce without access to the database, or some information 
 * leakage from the website (this is currently possible).
 * 
 * There will need to be some fixing of some things in the upcoming 
 * pre-release versions, including some updates to the registration 
 * process.  I have seen the creation of multiple verification entries
 * in the database.
